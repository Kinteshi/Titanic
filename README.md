# Titanic Survival Prediction

This is a project to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. This is my spin on the classic Kaggle competition. The intention of this project is to demonstrate my abilities and start a portfolio of projects. 

The dataset is from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). The dataset contains 891 rows and 12 columns.
